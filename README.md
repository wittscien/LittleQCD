# LittleQCD

[LittleQCD](https://github.com/wittscien/LittleQCD) is my own fun game while studying Lattice QCD.

I persue this project because I want to implement all the details and to be confident when using any LQCD software. The project could become a valuable crosscheck. Not aiming for practical production.
