# LittleQCD

[LittleQCD](https://github.com/wittscien/LittleQCD) is my personal fun game while studying Lattice QCD.

I play this game to implement the lattice field theory from scratch and be confident when using any software. The project could become a crosscheck. Not aiming for practical production. (in the future let's see.)

The following will be possible after I upload to PyPI.
